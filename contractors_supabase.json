She is very nervous about making the jump, but she’s traveled to all her plants at her current position and done similar work helping make everything uniform between plants. She wants to continue doing similar work, going to new plants, working on different projects, etc. It’s just her so she doesn’t have any other decision makers at home. Do you think we could keep her busy for a while? She’s perfect for Fremont but I’d like to get her on at least a 3-6 month project to start her out. Thoughts? She can do SAP/Planning/Storeroom.
