# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing critical authentication and employee record issues that prevent users from creating tasks, adding history entries, and viewing assigned contractors. These issues stem from inconsistent employee record creation, authentication state management, and database access patterns. This spec addresses all authentication-related problems to ensure seamless user experience across contractor management features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Employee Record Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my employee record to be automatically created and consistently available, so that I can perform all contractor management actions without authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL automatically create an internal_employee record if one doesn't exist
2. WHEN a user's session is active THEN the employee record SHALL be immediately available in all components
3. IF an employee record creation fails THEN the system SHALL retry the creation process
4. WHEN checking for employee records THEN the system SHALL use consistent user_id matching across all queries
5. WHEN an employee record is created THEN it SHALL include all required fields (user_id, email, full_name)

### Requirement 2: Consistent Authentication State

**User Story:** As a user performing contractor management tasks, I want authentication to work reliably across all features, so that I don't encounter "user not authenticated" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating contractor tasks THEN the system SHALL use the authenticated user's ID consistently
2. WHEN adding contractor history entries THEN the system SHALL properly identify the current user
3. WHEN viewing assigned contractors THEN the system SHALL correctly match employee records to user sessions
4. IF authentication state is unclear THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN switching between pages THEN authentication state SHALL persist without requiring re-authentication

### Requirement 3: Robust Task Management

**User Story:** As an internal employee, I want to create and manage contractor tasks without encountering authentication errors, so that I can track contractor work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new task THEN the system SHALL automatically populate created_by with the current user's ID
2. WHEN saving a task THEN the system SHALL validate that the user is authenticated before proceeding
3. IF task creation fails due to authentication THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
4. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL show tasks created by the current user and public tasks
5. WHEN updating task status THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions before allowing changes

### Requirement 4: Reliable History Tracking

**User Story:** As an internal employee, I want to add history entries to contractor profiles without authentication failures, so that I can maintain accurate contractor interaction records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a history entry THEN the system SHALL automatically set created_by to the current user's ID
2. WHEN saving history entries THEN the system SHALL ensure the user has a valid employee record
3. IF history creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details for troubleshooting
4. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display the creator's name for each entry
5. WHEN multiple users add history THEN the system SHALL correctly attribute each entry to its creator

### Requirement 5: Accurate Contractor Assignments

**User Story:** As an internal employee, I want to view contractors assigned to me on the dashboard, so that I can manage my contractor relationships effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a contractor assignment THEN the system SHALL use the correct employee ID for the link
2. WHEN viewing "My Contractors" THEN the system SHALL query using the current user's employee ID
3. IF no contractors are assigned THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message explaining how to assign contractors
4. WHEN contractor assignments are created THEN they SHALL immediately appear in the dashboard view
5. WHEN debugging assignment issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user encountering authentication issues, I want clear error messages and recovery options, so that I can resolve problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating the problem
2. WHEN employee records are missing THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic creation with user feedback
3. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide actionable steps for resolution
5. WHEN system state is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL offer refresh or re-authentication options

### Requirement 7: Database Access Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all database queries to work consistently with proper permissions, so that users don't encounter access denied errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying contractor_internal_link THEN the system SHALL have proper RLS policies allowing authenticated access
2. WHEN accessing contractor_task table THEN users SHALL be able to create, read, update, and delete their own tasks
3. WHEN querying contractor_history THEN users SHALL have full access to create and view history entries
4. IF RLS policies block access THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN database schema changes THEN all related policies SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 8: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting authentication issues, I want comprehensive debugging tools and logging, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging authentication THEN the system SHALL provide detailed console logging of user and employee states
2. WHEN testing contractor assignments THEN debug tools SHALL show all relevant database records
3. IF authentication flows fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific failure points
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN additional debugging information SHALL be available
5. WHEN troubleshooting database issues THEN SQL debugging scripts SHALL be provided for manual verification
